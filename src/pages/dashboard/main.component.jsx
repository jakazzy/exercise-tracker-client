      Is it thy will, thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary
      night? Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken, While shadows like
      to thee do mock my sight? Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee So
      far from home into my deeds to pry, To find out shames and idle hours in
      me, The scope and tenure of thy jealousy? O, no! thy love, though much, is
      not so great: It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
