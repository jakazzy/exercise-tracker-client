      Who will believe my verse in time to come, If it were fill'd with your
      most high deserts? Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides
      your life, and shows not half your parts. If I could write the beauty of
      your eyes, And in fresh numbers number all your graces, The age to come
      would say 'This poet lies; Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly
      faces.' So should my papers, yellow'd with their age, Be scorn'd, like old
      men of less truth than tongue,
